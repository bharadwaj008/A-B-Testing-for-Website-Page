## Problem Statement:
So, here's the deal: you're a member of the product team of a medium-sized e-commerce company. In an effort to increase conversions, the UX designer put in a lot of time and effort to revamp the product page. According to the product manager (PM), the current conversion rate is around 13% year-round, and the team is satisfied with a 2% rise. Therefore, if the new design can lift the conversion rate to 15%, it will be deemed a success.

## Objective
You recommend doing an A/B test on a portion of your user base before releasing the modification to the public so that the team can gauge its reception and potential problems.
